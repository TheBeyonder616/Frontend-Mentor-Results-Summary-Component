## My Process

This project focuses on creating a visually engaging and interactive results summary component. Key features include a responsive layout, smooth transitions, and interactive states. The design leverages modern CSS techniques and follows a structured approach for CSS organization and layout.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** Utilized semantic HTML elements to enhance accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS:** Employed custom properties (variables) for consistent styling, Flexbox and Grid for layout, and responsive design techniques.
- **SCSS:** Used SCSS for modular and maintainable CSS with advanced features like variables, nesting, and mixins.

### BEM Methodology

In this project, the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology was used to structure the CSS, improving maintainability and readability. Hereâ€™s how BEM was applied:

- **Block:** Represents the main components (e.g., `.component`, `.summary`, `.heading`).
- **Element:** Represents a part of a block (e.g., `.heading-text`, `.summary-cards__card`, `.value`).
- **Modifier:** Represents variations or states of blocks or elements (e.g., `.card--reaction`, `.card--memory`).

#### Example BEM Structure

- **Component Block:**

  ```scss
  .component {
    // Block styles

    &__heading {
      // Element styles
    }

    &__summary {
      // Element styles
    }

    &--large {
      // Modifier styles
    }
  }
  ```

- **Summary Cards Block:**

  ```scss
  .summary-cards {
    // Block styles

    &__card {
      // Element styles
    }

    &__card--reaction {
      // Modifier styles
    }

    &__card--memory {
      // Modifier styles
    }
  }
  ```

### What I Learned

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in:

- **HTML Semantics:** Structuring HTML to improve accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Using CSS variables for dynamic and consistent styling.
- **SCSS:** Applying SCSS for modular and maintainable CSS with features like variables and nesting.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilizing Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive and adaptable layouts.
- **Animations:** Implementing smooth and interactive animations to enhance user experience.

### Continued Development

Future updates may include:

- **Enhanced JavaScript Interactions:** Adding more interactive features and dynamic behavior.
- **Complex Animations:** Introducing more sophisticated CSS animations and transitions.
- **Accessibility Improvements:** Ensuring all interactive elements are fully accessible and improving overall user experience.
